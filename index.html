    <h1><i>Bandarban - An Attractive Travel Destination in Bangladesh
        </i></h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            South Asian country <b><i>Bangladesh</i></b> is blessed with natural beauty and can also be a great
            destination for traveling. There are some hilly areas here under the <i>Chittagong Hill Tracts</i> and
            <strong>Bandarban</strong> is one of them, others are <em>Rangamati</em> and <em>Khagrachari</em>. Last year
            (Aug 15, 2023 to Aug 19, 2023) during Rainy Season it was a great pleasure to travel to some truly
            attractive destinations with my friend. We did visit Kaptai, Rangamati, and Bandarban and frankly speaking
            without visiting those places it will be totally unknown to me that my own country is such beauty in a true
            sense. So how was my Bandarban tour? Explore details inside. <br>

            <b>What I’ve loved most in Bandarban?</b> I was in love with nature here. I’ve loved to play with green,
            blue and white. Awe, thinking!! What are those? Yes, they are my favorite green leaves, bushes, blue sky and
            white clouds. I really lost myself here with natural waterfalls, river, and mountains. I’ll recommend all
            tourists and mainly nature lovers to visit this naturally beautiful destination in Asia. The largest
            Buddhist Golden Temple, Buddha Dhatu Jadi is also located in the Bandarban district of Bangladesh.
